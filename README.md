# NOTE
I cloned this from the original repo at https://github.com/getcontrol/KYC-train-model, so credit goes to @getcontrol. I simply migrated the tensorflow version to 2.x.x.

# Train Tensorflow Model for Tensorflow Verification

This repo contains the Python code to produce the dataset and train the Tensorflow model for use in [KYC-tensorflow](https://github.com/getcontrol/KYC-tensorflow). This training model transfers learning from a previously trained model mobilenet_v2.

# Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repo.

``` git clone https://github.com/getcontrol/KYC-train-model ```

``` cd KYC-train-model```

2. Download and unzip the the MIDV-500 formatted dataset to 'verification-train-model' directory.

https://www.dropbox.com/s/dmjbat0e1re5rkf/midv_500.zip?dl=0

3. Make a 'data' directory in verification-train-model for the dataset generation and an 'output' folder for testing.

```mkdir data```

```mkdir output```

4. Create and activate a Python 3 Virtual environment.

```python3 -m venv env```

```source env/bin/activate```

5. Install Requirements.

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

6. Synthesize training data.

```python synthesis_data.py```

```python receipt_dataset.py```

7. Train model.

```python train.py```

# Test Model

Samples are included in 'test_samples_600*800'.

```python test.py```
